\section*{Summary}
Computer programming has been my hobby since school days. I started with BASIC
programming in 1990. I was fascinated with DOS games and in my quest to write
fast games, I moved from BASIC to assembly to C. On the way, I got hooked on to
protected mode and eventually operating system kernel programming. I have a few
projects registered with github (and earlier google projects) –  some of the
interesting ones are, a port of minix3 microkernel so that it builds on Linux
and a Ruby based VNC automation engine.

Professionally, I started my career with Seranova where I worked on Java based
internet solutions. I switched jobs in the earlier part of my career mainly to
get involved with embedded systems.  In the later part, it was for looking for
larger roles where I could contribute more with my deep understanding of
software and exposure to a wide range of it.  In my current job, I’ve lead
geographically distributed cross-functional teams to deliver multiple releases
and fixpacks of the product. I am looking for a job where I can focus on using
my computer skills to solve larger problems – help people with leveraging
various kinds of automations. My experience has predominantly been on Linux,
but I am happy to work on other platforms.


\section*{Some career highlights}
\begin{itemize}
\item Filed a patent around image processing based computer UI automation –
with a POC implementation – did a rudimentary implementation using VNC and
OpenCV

\item Very interested in operating system development – implemented multiple
monolithic x86 kernels as hobby projects. Currently fascinated by microkernels.

\item Have been pursuing functional programming – Haskell in particular.

\item Managed product development teams through multiple major releases and
fix-packs  

\item Driven beta programs

\item Experienced in managing and co-ordinating globally distributed
cross-functional teams

\item Deep understanding of software development

\item Deployed innovative virtualization solutions with ESX and qemu for
productivity enhancement

\item Have 9+ years of experience in software development with 2+ years in
people management

\item Passed out with integrated Masters degree in Management studies from BITS
Pilani in 2000
