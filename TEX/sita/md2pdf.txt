# the problem

## office software sucks

### all office software sucks
  * but presentation software sucks more
  * it requires too much mousing around
      * doesn't matter if it is OpenOffice or MS Office
      * I hate them both equally
  * and I hate mice
      * @@nasty, smelly, things
      * @@never even have a bath, what a life...

### My presentations
  * all these years, my presentations have consisted of
      * plain text on plain white backgrounds
      * with hardly any pictures
          * @@I start sweating if I have to make a picture or a chart
          * @@even if I'm using OpenOffice

### My preferred editor
  * for everything and anything under the sun
  * @@is "[vim](http://www.vim.org)"
  * @@even my firefox browser uses
    "[vimperator](http://vimperator.mozdev.org/)", an extension which lets me
    use vi keystrokes instead of the mouse :-)

### so the problem is this:
  * @@I want to make presentations using plain text
  * @@and if they can look prettier and feel slicker, that's a bonus

### in the interest of time

(...and your sanity)

I will not bore you with all the stuff that failed...

# the pieces start to fall in

## text to HTML

### simple HTML made even simpler
  * I'd been using Markdown for a year or so now
  * Markdown is one of the seventeen thousand or so markup languages in the
    world
      * very simple text to HTML conversion
      * indentation based for easy lists
      * italics is like `*italics*`
      * bold is like `**bold**`
          * ...and so on; more details
            [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

## LaTeX to PDF

### detour: LaTeX
  * in the beginning, Don Knuth created TeX
      * (yes, I know it's blasphemy to not format that correctly)
  * then Leslie Lamport created [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/)
      * most popular and powerful text processing language in academia
  * then Till Tantau came up with
    [Beamer](http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/)

### beamer kicks ass
  * it produces PDF
  * @@some fantastic PDF actually
  * @@look at the slide navigation on this one and the other two
  * @@try clicking around to go to other parts of the PDF
  * @@I defy anyone to come up with this kind of navigation in MS or
    OpenOffice!
      * I'm only showing three themes; there are many more
      * and you can make your own (in fact all these have a subtle mod that my
        `mdbeamer` produces)

### so all I need is...

...some way to convert HTML to LaTeX-beamer syntax

# the last piece
## HTML to LaTeX
### is "mdbeamer.pl"
  * a 150-line perl program I wrote to convert HTML to beamer
  * very simple, but handles all the markups I care about
  * some parts of it feel a little kludgy because of the HTML in between

# bonus: images
## aka: text to graphics
### detour: graphviz
   * I'd recently discovered [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)
   * excellent for drawing simple diagrams
   * for example, this code

        digraph {
            node[fontsize=24]
            a -> b -> c -> d
            b -> p -> q -> x
            p -> y
        }

### detour: graphviz
  * produces this:

<!-- include image demo [height=4cm] a git tree? -->

<!-- begin graphviz demo
        digraph {
            a -> b -> c -> d
            b -> p -> q -> x
            p -> y
        }
end graphviz -->

### and something like this...

\tiny

    digraph G {
        subgraph clusterCS {
            label="Chennai server\n\ \ \ "

            cs2 [shape=box, label="bare repo\non server", style=filled, fillcolor=green]
            node [style=invis]
            edge [style=invis]
            cs1 -> cs2
        }
        subgraph clusterCL {
            label="Commits on\nChennai Lead PC"

            node [shape=box, style=rounded, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue]
            c1 [label = "Commit #1\n.gitignore"]
            c2 [label = "Commit #2\nSource\nFiles"]
            c1 -> c2
        }
        cs2 -> c2 [lhead=clusterCL, ltail=clusterCS, label = "push", dir=back, color=red, constraint = false]
    }

### produces this

<!-- include image demo2 [height=4cm] a more complicated figure -->

<!-- begin graphviz demo2

    digraph G {
        rankdir = BT
        splines=false
        nodesep = 1.0
        edge [dir=none]

        compound = true

        subgraph clusterCS {
            label="Chennai server\n\ \ \ "

            cs2 [shape=box, label="bare repo\non server", style=filled, fillcolor=green]
            node [style=invis]
            edge [style=invis]
            cs1 -> cs2
        }
        subgraph clusterCL {
            label="Commits on\nChennai Lead PC"

            node [shape=box, style=rounded, style=filled, fillcolor=lightblue]
            c1 [label = "Commit #1\n.gitignore"]
            c2 [label = "Commit #2\nSource\nFiles"]
            c1 -> c2
        }

        cs2 -> c2 [lhead=clusterCL, ltail=clusterCS, label = "push", dir=back, color=red, constraint = false]
    }

end graphviz -->

# the end
### so really the last piece
  * well, I'm taking the HTML and converting it to LaTeX anyway
  * so, devise a simple syntax to embed graphviz code directly into the text
  * and make my `mdbeamer` program
      * extract that code
      * call graphviz
      * produce the image

And.... we're done.  I can do pretty much everything in text now!  And
***everything*** stays in one simple text file!
